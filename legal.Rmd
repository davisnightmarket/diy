# PERMITS

# LIABILITY

Disclaimer: the following only applies to the U.S. 

**TLDR**: here's a handy <a href="docs/liability_flowchart.pdf" target="_blank">liability flow chart.</a> that will get you started. 

For those who want to get in the nitty gritty... keep reading 

So you need to know that

## 1. **getting sued for donating food is basically not a thing** 

This [report](https://law.uark.edu/documents/2013/06/Legal-Guide-To-Food-Recovery.pdf) by the University of Arkansas School of Law found that "lawsuits arising out of
the donation or provision of recovered food are extremely uncommon. Indeed, **a thorough search of filings and review of reported decisions did not turn up a single case that
involved food donation-related liability** or any attempts to get around the protections offered by the Bill Emerson Act. Additionally, several leading food recovery experts and antihunger advocates report that they are unaware of any such
actual or threatened lawsuits. The absence of litigation or other disputes related to food donation demonstrates that fear of lawsuits or other negative publicity related to mishaps with donated food are overstated and largely illusory barriers to food recovery." 

## 2. **you and your donors are protected by the federal law, as long as you are a non-profit** 

These are the 4 requirements to receive protection from the federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act: 

1. The donation must be
made to a nonprofit
organization.

2. The food must be donated to a nonprofit organization in good faith, meaning that the food must be donated with the honest belief that it is safe to eat

3. The donated items must be
either apparently wholesome
food or apparently fit grocery
products

4. The nonprofit organization that receives the donated food must distribute it to needy individuals, who must not pay anything of monetary value for the donated food

### i'm not a non-profit. now what?

it's ok! you have options

1. you're probably fine anyway (see point 1 "getting sued for donating food is basically not a thing"). jk

2. **get a fiscal sponsor**

a fiscal sponsor is basically a 501(c)(3) non-profit that agrees to sponsor you such that you share their 501(c)(3) non-profit status. they also receive your money, so you'll have to send them a budget once a year (which can be $0). 

relationships with fiscal sponsors may vary, but, luckily, we have a solution for you! 

our fiscal sponsor, [Left Lovers](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ca/201718410104) (yes, it's a real non-profit, not a movie about sexy vampires) is very happy to sponsor food recovery efforts without taking a chunk of your money. the only thing they might ask is a yearly insurance fee to cover your operation. if you're interested in being sponsored by left lovers, fill in [this fiscal sponsorship form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dha31GaLD_fZ1qEfy21PBgq5owvEllJd/view) and contact ernst@freedge.org or nightmarket@freedge.org 


3. **become a 501(c)(3) non-profit** 

might be worth it depending on your needs

#### compare your options

here's a good, if slightly caustic toward fiscal sponsors (like i said, i promise left lovers won't actually suck you dry) comparison of your <a href="docs/non-profit-status.pdf" target="_blank">options for acquiring non-profit-status</a> from [big door brigade](http://bigdoorbrigade.com/category/handling-money-and-taxes/), a compilation of resources for mutual aid orgs that's worth checking out either way.
