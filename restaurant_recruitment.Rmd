# MATERIALS

* Boxes
must be food grade (needed for permit)

* Teams
recommended 2 people per location, to minimize the time spent distributing food into boxes.

* Packaging / Cleaning Procedure: food safety practices require food to be removed from its original packaging and stored in a working container that must be food-grade and labeled 
	Materials: Hand sanitizer, utensils (spoons, ladles, etc. in a plastic bag or a ziploc), sharpie, paper towels/napkins 
	
# HOW TO
Apply hand sanitizer
Distribute food into individual boxes 
Label the boxes with the contents (the more detail, the less impulse people will have to open the boxes to see what is inside, which is against code)
Clean the space (important in order to maintain the goodwill of the donor businesses) 
Load your bike cart an    d go! :) 
Unload at distribution location: consumers should not open boxes, if they do, they have to keep them. 
 
Establishing a connection with the Donor (consistency): it is recommended to have the same people performing the same pick-ups to establish rapport with the establishmentâ€™s employees. In addition, calling the donor business in advance to ask if they have anything to offer is good practice.
